import hashlib
import base64

username = "fuzzlaw"
password = "rockyscout"

# Generate bcrypt-style hash for htpasswd
import hashlib
pwd_hash = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).digest()
pwd_b64 = base64.b64encode(pwd_hash).decode()

with open('htpasswd', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{username}:{{{pwd_b64}}}\n")

print(f"htpasswd file created for user: {username}")
```

You'll run this once locally or we can handle it differently — actually, the cleanest approach for a non-programmer is to use a free online htpasswd generator. Go to **htpasswd-generator.de** in your browser, enter your chosen username and password, select **SHA-1** as the format, and click Generate. You'll get a single line of text that looks something like:
```
yourusername:{SHA}W6ph5Mm5Pz8GgiULbPgzG37mj9g=
```

Create a new file in your repository called `htpasswd` and paste that line into it as the entire contents. Commit it.

**Step 4: Add a Requirements File**

Create a file called `requirements.txt` in your repository and paste in the following:
```
datasette
datasette-auth-passwords
sqlite-utils
